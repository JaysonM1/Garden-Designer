Our project is used to design and build gardens. The user is given a menu of plants 
from a drop down, as well as other drop down options. A description of each plant is available before dragging and dropping.
The user can drag and drop plants onto the workspace and view the garden along with some surrounding area with a top-down view. 
Garden and plant characteristics are taken into account when the garden is rated.
